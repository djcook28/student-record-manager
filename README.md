ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Hidden column (Enrollment ID) is essential for correctly identifying rows during edit/delete operations.
- When a table cell is clicked, the status bar buttons adapt based on the selected row.
- Database connection errors or missing tables will raise runtime exceptions â€” make sure schema is initialized.
